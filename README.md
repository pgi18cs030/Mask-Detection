# Mask-Detection
As Social Distancing is only tool to prevent COVID-19 wearing face masks is compulsory. To monitor the mass no of people whether they wear a mask or not I came up with a solution using deep learning Here I can used Convulutional Nueral Networks(CNN) to predict whether the person is wearing the mask or not . I took the person images with and with_out masks through web scraping and started working on it. the dataset consists of nearly 2000.  Our Model performs fairly well with an accuracy of 98% and an F1 Score of 97%. This provides a handy tool to utilize the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Binary Classification Problems where time and accuracy is the paramount objective of classification.
